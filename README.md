# CS-440

## Course Description
Introduction to computer networking including basic networking concepts and components, architecture, protocols, server types, network operating systems and network security.

## Programs
### Program 1
[Program 1](https://github.com/ZacharyHandel/CS-440/tree/master/program-1) was a simple C program to warm us up for further coding.
### Program 2
[Program 2](https://github.com/ZacharyHandel/CS-440/tree/master/program-2) was a client/server connection where a server would send a client the current date and time.
### Program 3
[Program 3](https://github.com/ZacharyHandel/CS-440/tree/master/program-3) was a client/server connection that would uses message operation codes for the client and server to connect. The interaction acted as an 8 ball where the client would ask the quesiton and the server would respond with a number of random messages.
### Program 4
Program 4 was an on-paper assignment and cannot be provided.
### Program 5
Program 5 was an on-paper assignment and cannot be provided.
### Program 6
Program 6 was an on-paper assignment and cannot be provided.
### Program 7
[Program 7](https://github.com/ZacharyHandel/CS-440/tree/master/program-7) This is a client/server connection where the client will implement a utility to fetch a single asset (file) from a web server and save it into a file.
### Program 8
[Program 8](https://github.com/ZacharyHandel/CS-440/edit/master/program-8/README.md) is a client/server connection that uses a simple FTP protocol to send different message types to perform various tasks. More information can be found in the [README](https://github.com/ZacharyHandel/CS-440/blob/master/program-8/README.md) of the program.
### Program 9
[Program 9](https://github.com/ZacharyHandel/CS-440/tree/master/program-9) is a client/server connection that was required for the class's final exam. It uses a basic directory listing protocol where the server will send a specific listing from a requested directory to the client. 
All programs use TCP socket programming in C. They are server/client connections with various tasks like file transfer and directory listing.
